# Kafka_Ecommerce
Here is a simulation of an ecommerce application where each consumer is depended on kafka messages created by a producer script

The createdatabase.py is the first script you have to run
producer.py is the second script to run
Manually change the time on your computer to 00:00 for consumer 3.py to trigger.
Producer.py needs to be paused for Consumer3.py to work aswell...

I also added the database file incase there were any issues loading that.
I personally used DB broswer to view the database
